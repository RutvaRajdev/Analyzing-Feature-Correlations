# Analyzing-Feature-Correlations

Analyzing and understanding feature correlation is important when developing a classification model. Highly correlated features might add redundancy leading to an inefficient model. The objective was to generate a linear model of one of the features using the remaining features. The goal here was to find the best linear model among all these. The Iris dataset was used for this purpose. A matrix of scatter plots was created with one scatter plot for each pairwise combination of features. Next, a linear regression model along with the statistics such as coefficients, mean squared error and variance was created for each of these pair-wise combinations. Also, multivariate regression was performed for each of the remaining combinations. The statistics and scatter plots were used for analysis.
